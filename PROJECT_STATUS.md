# Project Status

## Current State

- M1 scaffold and M2 understanding/decision logic are implemented.
- Battle Awareness main chain is implemented.
- Hosted UI Integration is complete.
- Minimal Panel is complete.
- Logic self-check currently passes: `29/29`.
- Default runtime mode is `dry_run = true`; the plugin runs the decision chain but does not push real catgirl speech until dry run is disabled.
- The plugin boundary is HTTP `:8112` (`/api/telemetry`) only. It consumes the vendored data layer and must not import or modify `data_layer/` code.

## Ready to Hand Off

- Core contracts, scenario machine, detectors, arbiter, safety guard, dispatcher, tests, and replay tool are present.
- Hosted UI surface, dashboard context, actions, and minimal panel are present.
- Design docs are complete for the current v1 scope: D-B1 through D-B5, implementation plan, data-layer TODOs, and real-machine validation checklist.
- Vendored data layer is included under `data_layer/data process/`.

## Not Done Yet

- Real-machine/data-layer seams are not validated.
- Data-layer blockers are not resolved.
- Data-layer subprocess orchestration is not implemented.
- `T-Safety: output text sanitizer` is planned but not implemented yet.
- M3 event unstubbing is waiting on data-layer support for overspeed flags, HUD/combat parsing, and stable `player_name`.
- Kill/death/hudmsg/combat.feed real speech is blocked on T-Safety; numeric flight-safety events such as stall, low altitude, overheat, and low fuel are not blocked by it.
- `contract/telemetry_sample.json` is still waiting for a real `/api/telemetry` capture.
- i18n currently has only a `zh-CN` placeholder; full 8-locale coverage is expected when future panel copy expands.

## Verification

Run from the N.E.K.O repository root:

```powershell
uv run python plugin/plugins/neko_warthunder/tests/run_logic_tests.py
uv run pytest plugin/plugins/neko_warthunder/tests -q
```

The real-machine checklist is in `docs/真机验证-checklist.md`.

## Next Recommended Work

1. Add T4 integration tests for `DetectorEngine.feed`, dispatcher prompt building, and scenario multi-tick sequences.
2. Add `T-Safety: output text sanitizer` before formal kill/death/hudmsg/combat.feed speech.
3. Keep T3/L8 data-layer subprocess orchestration for a later runtime pass.
4. Run the remaining real-machine/data-layer/real-speech seams from `docs/真机验证-checklist.md` when the environment is available.
5. Capture `contract/telemetry_sample.json` from a real `/api/telemetry` response.
6. Unstub overspeed and kill/death handling after the data layer provides the missing fields and T-Safety is in place.
